## Running it
Commands:
* `npm install` - install the dependencies
* `npm start` - run in production
* `npm run dev` - run in hot-reloading mode

You will need `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in the environment; for development it can be loaded from `.env`,
for production it has to be in the environment already.
